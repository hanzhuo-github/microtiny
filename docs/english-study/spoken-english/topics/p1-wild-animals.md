# 3. Model Answers

## 3.1 Have you ever seen wild animals before?

**Well**, I have seen lots in the zoo, such as lions and elephants, but I've never seen those kinds of animals ==in the wild==.

**When I was a kid growing up**, I saw lots of foxes, **because** there were plenty of them in the forests near where I used to live.


## 3.2 Do you like to go to the zoo?

**Yes an no**.

I guess **on the one hand**, zoos are fun and it's amazing ==to get up close== to those magnificent creatures like the lions.

But, **on the other hand**, the cages in many zoos are too ==cramped== and the **living conditions** of many animals ==leave a lot to be desired==.

- get up close, get close up <-> get far away
> I'd love to get close up to a panda.
>
> I would love to get far away from a lion.

- cramped adj  .
> = not enough space

- leave a lot to be desired
> = not good enough

:::details Chapter 4: Animals 
The following weekend, Tom took Emily to Chester zoo. He **had something in mind**. 

He knew Emily loved animals and **had always wanted to** go on Safari in Africa, but they had never ==got round to== <u>organizing</u> it. ==Not to mention== it would ==cost an arm and a leg==.

==Strolling round== the zoo, they saw the tigers, monkeys, giraffes and many more 
wild animals.

As they sat on a bench **opposite** the lions, having a coffee, Tom ==fumbled for== something in his pocket. He took out a little box and suddenly ==went down on one knee==. He ==popped== the question.

"Emily, will you marry me?"

Emily was initially ==in shock==, then smiled and accepted ==without giving it a second thought==. 

The lions also stopped and smiled, as if posing for a photo.

What a beautiful day! 

Not wanting to waste any time, they got married <u>within</u> a month. 

For their honeymoon, they choose, of course, to go on a Safari to Kenya. Finally, they would see all those beautiful animals ==in the wild==. 

When they finally arrived in Kenya, they were so excited, they could **hardly** believe it. They stayed some nights in a hotel, and some nights in a tent, getting close to nature.

One evening, as they sat in their tent, deep in the wild, Tom and Emily **looked out at the <u>vast expanse</u> of nature surrounding them**. They cold see giraffes chewing leaves on treetops ==in the distance==. 

"It's amazing to ==get close up to== these animals in their natural habitats," Tom 
said. "It's so different from seeing them in those ==cramped cages== at the zoo.”
"I agree," Emily replied. "Those zoo enclosures ==leave a lot to be desired==. You 
know, many of these animals are ==in danger of extinction==, and I know zoos try 
to help, but there is so much more we should be doing to protect them."

Tom smiled, "That's why I love you, Emily. You're always thinking of others."

But little did they know, danger was ==lurking== just beyond the trees.
