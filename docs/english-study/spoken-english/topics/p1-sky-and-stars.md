# 5. Watchful Eyes

:::details A tale of love, danger and survival, Chapter 1: The Sky and Stars

Tom and Emily had been friends since they were children. Growing up in the 
small town of Glossop, in the north of England, they had spent ==countless== days 
exploring the nearby woods, riding bikes down the winding roads, and imagining all the adventures they would one day have.

At the age of 21, their friendship ==blossomed into something more==, and they started going out together. Tom was always there for Emily, ==through the ups and downs of life==, and she knew that she could always ==count on== him.

Now, as they ==approached their mid-twenties==, Tom and Emily were living together in a <u>cozy</u> apartment ==in the heart of Manchester.== 

They both worked hard, Tom as a software engineer and Emily as a graphic designer, but they always found time for each other, whether it was cooking dinner together, **going for walks** in the park, or just ==binge-watching their favorite TV shows==.

Despite the **busy city life**, Tom and Emily still ==longed for== the quiet nights and 
==<u>star-filled</u> skies **of their childhood**==. They often talked about **taking a trip** to the countryside to stargaze and ==get away from the **hustle and bustle** of city life==.

Little did Emily know, Tom had a surprise planned that would make all of her 
dreams come true.

One spring morning, as the sunrise slowly **peeked through** the overcast sky of 
Manchester, Tom and Emily were already ==up and about==, taking in the beauty of 
the morning sky. They loved to take the time **to look up <u>at</u> the sky**, <u>whenever</u> they got the chance. 

"This sunrise is more beautiful than any sunset I have seen." Tom said smiling, 
"and those fading constellations are amazing, but Emily **none of them compare 
to your beauty.**"

Emily blushed, "Come on Mr. Romantic, time for breakfast!"

Secretly though, she loved this side of Tom.

"Emily, there's something I've been ==meaning to== tell you," Tom said, **taking her 
hand**. "I know we've talked about seeing the Milky Way together someday, but 
I want to make that happen sooner, rather than later. I have a surprise planned 
for us."

Emily's ==eyes widened <u>with</u> excitement==, "What is it?"

"You'll have to wait and see," Tom replied with a smile.
