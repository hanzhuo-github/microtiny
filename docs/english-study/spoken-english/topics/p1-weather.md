## 3.1 What kind of weather do you like?

It rains a lot, and many days, it just ==pours down==, ==non-stop==.

In the summer though, it can get quite hot, ==temperatures get up to== 40 degrees, ==sweltering heat==. It's too hot for me, **to be honest**.

- pour down
> to rain a lot

> non-stop
> without stopping

- temperatures **get/go up to** 40 degrees 
>
> temperatures **go down to** minus 5 degrees 
> 
> temperatures **get as low as** minus 5 degrees 

- sweltering heat
> sweltering adj. 闷热的；热得难受的

## 3.2 Do you prefer dry or wet weather?

I prefer dry weather.

You can do so much more when it's not raining.

I can go walking or do any kind of ==outdoor sports==.

When it rains, it just ==puts me off== <u>going</u> out and I ==end up== <u>wasting</u> time ==doing nothing **in particular**== at home.

- to put you off doing it
> = to make you feel like not doing it

- end up

- doing nothing in particular
