# 3. Model Answers

## 3.1 Do you prefer to watch TV programmes on a TV or your mobile phone?

I **don't really mind**, probably ==a mix of both==, **to be honest**.

The TV, **obviously**, has <u>a bigger screen</u> and <u>better quality sound</u>, so it's overall a better ==viewing experience==.

That said, I am quite happy to watch a short ==episode== <u>on</u> my phone. And I've got some ==nifty, bluetooth headphones== too, ==over-ear== headphones which ==have a great sound==.

- I don't mind
> = I'm happy with both choices

- screen
> big/wide/small screen

- good/bad quality sound

- a good/optimal 最好的/bad/terrible viewing experience
> a mobile phone with a cracked screen, a bad internet connection -> you're gonna get a terrible viewing experience

- TV serious, films
> episode

- nifty 灵便的，漂亮的

- headphones/headsets 耳机
> bluetooth headphones, wired headphones 有线耳机, over-ear headphones, in-ear headphones


## 3.2 Do you always watch the same kinds of programmes?

Yes, I'm ==guilty of== often <u>watching</u> the same kinds of programmes. 

**I'm really into** crime and action series. They're just so easy to watch. And they always **keep you engaged** and ==on tenterhooks== <u>about</u> what's going to happen next. Yes, I'm a big fan of that kind of programme.

## 4.1 Do you prefer to watch TV programmes on your TV or mobile phone?

I prefer to watch TV programs on my TV rather than my mobile phone.

The **larger screen** and **better audio quality** of a TV ==**enhance** the overall viewing experience==, especially for movies and shows that are ==visually engaging==. 

That said, I do use my mobile phone to ==catch up on== shows or news when I'm ==on the go== or when I want to watch something quickly. 

So, it depends on the situation, but <u>if given the choice, I'd ==opt for==</u> the TV for ==a more <u>immersive</u> experience==.

- enhance the experience

- on the go 忙的时候，在路上

- Mobile phones provide the convenience of ==portability and flexibility==

- immersive  [ɪ'mɜ:sɪv]  沉浸的

## 4.2 Do you always watch the same kind of programmes?

No, I don't always watch the same kind of programs. I enjoy a variety of TV programs **depending on my <u>mood and interests</u>**. 

For example, I like to watch <u>documentaries</u> to learn about different <u>cultures and historical events</u>.

I also enjoy watching <u>movies</u>, especially those in the ==science fiction== and ==fantasy genres==. 

Additionally, I follow some <u>TV series</u>, both <u>drama</u> and <u>comedy</u>, for entertainment.

Furthermore, I occasionally watch <u>educational programs</u> or <u>news</u> to ==**stay informed** <u>about</u> **current events**==. 

So, my **viewing habits** are quite ==diverse==, and I like to <u>explore</u> different types of TV programs to keep things interesting.


- genres [ˈʒɑnrə] 体裁

> No, I don't always watch the same kind of programs. I enjoy a variety of ==genres== and like to ==switch things up== depending on my mood and interests. Sometimes I watch **dramas** or **crime series** for their ==compelling stories==, while other times I might ==tune into== documentaries to learn something new. I also enjoy **comedy shows** for some ==lighthearted entertainment==. So, I like to explore different types of TV programs to keep things <u>interesting and diverse</u> in my viewing habits.

# 5. Watchful Eyes

:::details Chapter 3: TV

After the walk in the park, Tom and Emily got home and ==settled in== to watch 
some TV. It’s true, they were both ==guilty of watching **rather** too much TV==. They 
were <u>huge</u> fans of all those new **crime series** on Netflix. 

"Let's watch something on our own big screen and we can ==try out== our new headphones," Tom said, handing Emily some ==nifty Bose headphones==.

They each ==put on their bluetooth headphones== to ==get the **full surround** sound experience==. They really appreciated the high-quality sound and it was incredible how it could make the programmes seem more ==immersive==.

They started watching a great <u>crime thriller</u> that they both enjoyed. The plot 
was full of surprises, and ==kept them on tenterhooks== **all the way through**. 

Towards the end of the episode, Tom suddenly turned to face Emily, and ==out of 
the blue== said, "Emily, I know we've been together for a while, but I still feel like there's so much I don't know about you," 

Emily looked at him <u>with</u> surprise, "What do you mean?"

"I mean, what are your hopes and dreams <u>for</u> the future? **Where do you see yourself in ten years?**" Tom asked, taking her hand.

Emily smiled, "I don’t think that far into the future Tom, but I guess I see myself with you. That’s the most important thing, right?"

**That was it**, Tom realized what he had to do!
