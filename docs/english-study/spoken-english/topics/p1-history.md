:::details Chapter 5: History 

**From the comfort of their tent**, they heard a ==rustling== sound <u>in</u> the trees. A wild cat, a ==caracal==, had ==wandered== close to their tent. It seemed to be looking for food.

Fortunately, the local guide had told them what to do if they ==stumbled upon== one.

They both **stayed perfectly still**, without saying a word, or **moving an inch**. The 
cat finally just walked past their tent, not even noticing them.They ==breathed a sigh of relief== and then laughed. 

**Undoubtedly**, they were really ==getting a taste for== adventure. What an amazing experience they could tell their friends about when they got home. 

**At the end of** the week, **it was time to** go home. They had had an amazing adventure, but they were also ready for some home comforts. 

They were back home, it was Friday night, and they decided it was film night. 

"What do you ==fancy== <u>watching</u>?" Tom asked, "Planet Earth?"

"Not more animals Tom, how about Downton Abbey! You know I've always been ==a big fan of== ==historical films== and ==period dramas==," Emily said as they settled in for a cozy night in. 

"I love getting a taste for what life was like in past times."

Tom nodded, "Sure, if you want. **I mean**, **I’m not really into** history," he said, 
"it just seems to be ==all facts and figures== to me, but I can see the appeal of some 
period dramas, although most of them are <u>rather</u> boring."

"Well, I suppose it's all about how you look at it," Emily said <u>with</u> a smile. "I 
love the <u>way</u> these stories reveal so much about society and human nature. I 
don’t think they are tedious at all."

"Ok, Downtown Abbey it is!" ==Exclaimed== Tom.

But as they started watching, Emily started to get ==edgy==. 

She suddenly had a strange feeling that someone was watching them.
