## 3.1 What helps you concentrate?

Peace and quiet.

**If there's** lots of ==background noise== ==going on==, **even if** it's not really loud, **then** it ==distracts== me and I just can't ==focus on== whatever I am doing.

So when I am reading or studying **for example**, ==I'm a stickler for== silence.

## 3.2 What do you do when you can't concentrate?

I find the best thing to do is stop whatever I am doing and go and do something else.

I mean I have some techniques I try, lke ==breaking my work down into== 20 minute ==chunks==, or drinking water, and that helps. 

But, ==more often than not==, I just change activity.

- chunks
> a piece of something

- break down
> break down my work/a problem/a project into pieces/into smaller, manageable chunks

- more often than not
> = usually

> More often than not, I have a siesta in the afternoon

:::details Chapter 6: Concentration
 
That strange feeling that someone is watching you, stayed <u>with</u> Emily for a few 
minutes but then disappeared as they watched the programme. The next day, 
Sunday, they decided to ==go out for brunch==, and then spend some time in their 
favorite coffee bar.

After eating, Tom wanted to read his new novel and Emily ==opted to== ==catch up on== 
some tasks that she had ==fallen behind with==.

As they sat in the coffee shop, more and more people came in, and it became ==a hive of activity==. Emily tried to ==focus on== her work, but the ==background noise== was **proving to be** too ==distracting==. 

"I'm such ==a stickler for== concentration," she said, frustrated. "I’m trying to plan 
my work for the next week, you know, ==breaking down my work into== small chunks. But how can I do that with all this noise?"

One of the waiters seemed to have ==turned up== the background music. Tom nodded sympathetically, "Yeah, I know how you feel. ==More often than not==, I need perfect silence to concentrate on my work. I don’t mean to be ==smug==, but that’s why I never take my work to a coffee shop."

Emily **took a deep breath**, trying to block out the noise. "I'll just have to try harder," she said.

But as she struggled to focus, that strange feeling she had had the previous day returned. She couldn't ==shake== the feeling that again someone was watching her every move.
