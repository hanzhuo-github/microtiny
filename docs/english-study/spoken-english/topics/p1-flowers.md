## 3.1 What kinds of flowers do you like?

I am **not really a flower person**, but I do buy flowers for our home ==now and again==, and I usually ==go for== carnations or roses.

I find the bright colors and ==soft petals== can give a fresh and relaxed feeling to the room.

## 3.2 Are there any flowers that have special meanings in your country?

**That's a good question**, I think the most well-known one is the rose.

A rose usually ==symbolizes== love and passion, so <u>we would</u> give a red rose to someone ==to express our love== <u>for</u> that person, or you might give it to someone you want **to go out with**/**to go on a date with**.

## 4.1 What kinds of flowers do you like?

I am not really a flower person. But when I buy flowers, I go for sunflowers and roses.

Sunflowers are vibrant, and convey a sense of happiness and warmth with their bright yellow petals and distinctive appearance.

Roses, on the other hand, represent love and affection. They have timeless elegance, come in a wide range of colors, each with its own unique symbolism.

## 4.2 Are there any flowers that have a special meaning in your country?

Of course. Actually I think many well-known flowers have their own special meanings.

For example, roses symbolize the love and passion. Sunflowers represent the positivity and warmth. And Lotus is a symbol of purity in my culture.


# 5. Watchful Eyes

:::details Chapter 2: Flowers
The next day, Tom surprised Emily with **a bunch of fresh flowers**, including a 
rose, colorful carnations, and some sunflowers. 

"This is lovely, but is this the surprise he was talking about?" Emily ==thought to 
herself==. 

She immediately **put them in a vase** and put them <u>alongside</u> the indoor plants 
they already had. She realized she hadn't watered them for a few days; they 
were looking dry and withered.

Tom interrupted her, "I thought we could go for a walk in our favorite park. You know there is a special place I want to show you," he said.

They ==jumped in the car== and ==headed out to== Heaton park. As they were ==walking 
around the park==, they ==came across== a well-known ==flower bed== that symbolized
love and friendship. 

"I think these petals would <u>express</u> our feelings perfectly," Tom said as he picked some pink and white ==blooms==.

"You can’t pick them Tom, just take a photo of me <u>with the flowers in the background</u>," said Emily. 

Tom ==took a few snaps== and as they walked through the park, Emily ==couldn't help 
but wonder== what other surprises Tom had ==in store for== her.
