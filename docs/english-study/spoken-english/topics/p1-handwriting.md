## 3.1 Do you think people will still write letters in the future?

**I'd say so yes**, I don't think we ==are about to== **give up** <u>writing</u> letters completely.

**To my mind**, many people feel they can ==express their emotions== better in a letter, and handwriting is more <u>personal</u>, so I think we **will still be writing letters** ==in the years to come==.

- to give up

- expression one's emotions

## 3.2 What do you think are the differences between writing with a pen and typing on a computer?

**Well, the way I see it**, writing with a pen is more <u>expressive</u>, because everyone has their own ==style of handwriting== which apparently can ==reveal a lot about themselves==.

**That said**, typing is <u>much neater</u> and it's <u>easier</u> to edit, you don't need to ==rub things out==.
