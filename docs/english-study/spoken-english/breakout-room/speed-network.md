- latency
> high latency: Longer distances often results in higher latency.
> 
> Low latency indicates faster network performance
>
> fast speed and low latency
>
> Low latency is crucial/essential <u>for</u> online gaming because it reduces the ==delay== between your actions and their impact/effects in the game.

# 2. Some topics

## 2.1 Do you know network latency?

Yes, of course.

Latency, also referred to as "ping" or "ping time". It is the time it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination in a network. 

And maybe everyone should know, lower latency ==indicate==s faster network performance.

## 2.2 Do you think network is important?

Definately Yes. Nowadays, people cannot live without network, it is highly important in modern life.

They serves as a foundation for communication, data sharing, and global connectivity.

Without networks, many of the technologies and services we rely on tody, including the internet, would not be possible.

## 2.3 the importance of network latency

Network latency **plays a crucial role in** the online gaming because it **directly** effects the ==responsiveness of the game==.

Low latency reduces the delay between your actions and their impact in the game. 

While the latency is high, there is a ==noticeable== delay, which can lead to ==frustrating experiences== and ==a competitive disadvantage==.

## 2.4 Factors affecting latency

- physical distance -> Longer distances often **result in** higher latency.

- network congestion -> If many users are ==accessing== the same server or network simultaneously, it can ==lead to== congestion and increase latency.

- Internet Service Provider (ISP)

- Wired connection (Ethernet) v.s. Wireless connection (Wi-fi)
