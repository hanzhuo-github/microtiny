## 1.2 Have you ever been to a zoo or a safari park?

Yes, I have had the opportunity to visit the Beijing Zoo.

During my visit, I was particularly excited to see the pandas that they have there. ~~The Beijing Zoo is home to **a population of** <u>giant pandas</u>, and it was an incredible experience to observe these magnificent creatures up close.~~

I remember seeing the pandas in a **specially designed** enclosure that mimicked their natural habitat, complete with bamboo and rocks. It was **truly** a memorable experience to watch them <u>eat bamboo, play, and ==laze around==</u>. 

Pandas are such adorable animals, and it was a privilege to see them ==in person== at the Beijing Zoo.

## 1.3 What is the animal you would like to see in the wild?

One animal I would like to see in the wild is the elephant. I think they are intelligent and interesting ==creatures==.

I have never seen them in real life, but I always see them on TV where they do various amazing things. For example, they can ==perform acrobatics==, also, they use their trunks to ==give massages== or paint pictures. 

Seeing them in their natural habitat would be a <u>fantastic</u> experience.


## 1.4 Are there TV programs about wild animals in your country?

Yes, in my country, there are TV programs about wild animals, and one popular show is called "动物世界" (Animal World). 

This program <u>showcases</u> **a wide variety of** wildlife from around the world, including their <u>behaviors</u>, <u>habitats</u>, and <u>conservation efforts</u>. 

It's a great way for people to **learn about** and **appreciate** the beauty and diversity of animals ==from the comfort of their homes==.



# 2. Week

## 2.1 What is your favorite day of the week?

~~My favorite day is probably Saturday. ~~

~~It's the day when I can unwind and have some free time to **work on** personal coding projects or learn new programming languages and technologies ==without the pressure of work deadlines==.~~

~~It allows me to ==explore my passion for ==coding and technology ==at my own pace==.~~


My favorite day of the week is Saturday. 

It's a day when I can unwind, relax, and **recharge after a busy week**.

I often use Saturdays to ==pursue my hobbies==, spend time with friends, or **simply enjoy some leisure activities**. It's a day when I don't have to ==worry about work-related tasks==, and I can focus on doing things that I truly enjoy.


## 2.2 What is your lease favorite day?

My least favorite day of the week **would have to be** Monday. 

It's the start of the <u>workweek</u>, and it can be **a bit challenging** to ==get back into the routine== after the weekend. There's often a lot ==to catch up on==, and it can feel ==a bit **overwhelming**== **at times**. 

However, once I ==get into the groove of== the week, it usually gets better, but Monday mornings can be a bit **tough** for me.

## 2.3 What is the busiest day of the week for you?

The busiest day of the week for me would **typically** be Wednesday. 

It's right **in the middle of the workweek**, and **by that time**, I've ==accumulated various tasks and responsibilities==. I often have deadlines to meet, and projects to <u>manage</u> during the middle of the week. 

So, Wednesday tends to be the day when ==my schedule is the most packed==, and I need to **be highly productive** ==to stay on top of my work==.

## 2.4 Is there anything that you do every day?

Yes, there are a few things that I do every day. One of the most important ==daily routines== for me is coding or programming. 

Also, I ==make it a point== ==to engage in== **physical exercise** every day, even if it's just ==a short workout== or a ==brisk walk==. 

Additionally, I try to learn something new every day, whether it's reading articles, **watching educational videos**, or studying new programming techniques.

Oh, I also ==dedicate some time to learning English==.

## 2.5 What do you usually do on weekends?

On weekends, I typically follow a relaxed routine. On Saturdays, I like to ==sleep in== until noon ==to catch up on rest==. After waking up, I often spend some time cleaning and organizing my room, which helps me start the weekend with a fresh environment. I also like to make plans for Sunday, whether it's deciding on activities, places to visit, or simply scheduling some leisure time.

Sundays are more social for me. I usually go out with friends to **explore new places**, **try out different restaurants**, or **engage in outdoor activities** like hiking or cycling. It's a great way to unwind and connect with friends after a busy workweek. 

Overall, my weekends ==**strike a balance** between relaxation and socializing==, allowing me to recharge for **the upcoming week**.

## 2.6 Are weekdays and weekends the same for you?

No, weekdays and weekends are not the same for me. 

Weekdays are **typically** focused on <u>work-related</u> tasks, such as software development, meetings, and project management. ~~I have a structured routine during the workweek to meet professional commitments.~~

In contrast, **weekends are a time for** <u>relaxation</u>, <u>leisure</u>, and <u>social activities</u>. I take advantage of the weekend to <u>unwind</u>, <u>rspend time with friends</u>, <u>pursue hobbies</u>, and <u>explore new experiences</u>. 

So, ==there's a clear **distinction** between the two==, with weekdays being more ==work-oriented== and weekends being a time for ==personal enjoyment and socializing==.
